※ Set up a security group for trusted IPs and ports to use, as shown in the example below.

| Direction | IP Protocol | Port range | Remote | Description | 
| :-------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: | :--- | 
| Ingress | TCP | 80 (HTTP) | 0.0.0.0/0 (CIDR) | WAF web service port | 
| Ingress | TCP | 443 (HTTPS) | 0.0.0.0/0 (CIDR) | WAF web service port | 
| Ingress | TCP | 5001 | x.x.x.x/32 (CIDR) | WAF management tool(UI) pot (Only allow administrator IP) | 
| Ingress | TCP | 22 (SSH) | x.x.x.x/32 (CIDR) | WAF SSH Terminal port (Only allow administrator IP) | 
| Ingress | TCP/HTTP | 5000 | IP of top LB of WAF<BR>x.x.x.x/32 (CIDR) | health check port between WAF(redundancy) and Top LB | 
| Egress | TCP | 443 (HTTPS) | 218.145.29.166/32 (CIDR) | WAF License Update server 
| Egress | TCP | 443 (HTTPS) | 218.145.29.101/32 (CIDR) | WAF License Update server | 
| Egress | TCP | 5001 | 218.145.29.168/32 (CIDR) | WAF Security rule(custom rule) Update server |

※ Note : When using WAF redundancy (when using the settings synchronization function) or Auto Scaling, ports 5984 and 6984 must be allowed between WAFs.

## Initial Settings for Web Firewall

* Initial setup after WAF initial run

1. Access Web Firewall Web Management Tool (UI) from a browser (chrome recommended)
    * https://WAF IP:5001
    * Login Access information : Contact ct@pentasecurity.com

2. Settings > System > Set time synchronization
    * Set up time servers Penta Server 1 & Penta Server 2 respectively

3. Network Settings > Proxy IP Settings
    * Enter network information checked in NHN console (WAF IP, gateway, netmask)

4. Set WAF Protection Targets
    * Network Settings > Setting up a protected server
    * Server mode: Select proxy and enter port
    * Enter web server IP (domain) and port (‘single’ or ‘multiple’ can be selected depending on infrastructure configuration)
    * Disable health check (only when entering web server domain)
    * Specify an SSL certificate if your WAF provides HTTPS services (requires pre-setup in the SSL Profile menu)

5. Set Protection Policy
    * Security Settings > Policy Settings > Add a new policy (default policy: Select 'Detect only and do not block')
    * Security Settings > Policy Settings > Add new website (apply to new policy)

* Notes when applying WAF
    * Change and configure network routing to apply WAF services to customer infrastructure environments through NHN Cloud Managed Service Provider (MSP).
    * Depending on the customer infrastructure configuration, DNS changes to WAF floating IP may be required or DNS changes to top load balancer IP may be required when configuring WAF redundancy.

## Operate Web Firewall

* Provide web firewall's overall user manual and how to use it in Web Firewall's Management Tools (UI).
