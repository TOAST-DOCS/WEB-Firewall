| Direction | IP Protocol | Port range | remote | description | 
| :-------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: | :--- | 
| Ingress | TCP | 80 (HTTP) | 0.0.0.0/0 (CIDR) | web service port | 
| Ingress | TCP | 443 (HTTPS) | 0.0.0.0/0 (CIDR) | web service port | 
| Ingress | TCP | 8443 | x.x.x.x/32 (CIDR) | Web firewall management port (Only allow administrator IP)| 
| Ingress | TCP | 22 (SSH) | x.x.x.x/32 (CIDR) | Web firewall terminal port(Only allow administrator IP)|
